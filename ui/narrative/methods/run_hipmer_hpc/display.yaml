# Configure the display and description of parameters
#
parameters :
    read_library_name :
        ui-name : Read Library
        short-hint : Read library (only PairedEnd Libs supported now)
    output_contigset_name:
        ui-name : Output ContigSet name
        short-hint : Enter a name for the assembled contigs data object
    mer_sizes:
        ui-name : k-mer sizes
        short-hint : |
            k-mer sizes to use in the assembly process.  This is a
            comma seperated list of integers to use as mer sizes.  For
            metagenomes you may want to use 21,31,51,77,95.
    ins_avg:
        ui-name : Insert Average (required if paired-end) (int)
        short-hint :  Estimated average Insert Length for Paired-End Reads in bp.
    ins_dev:
        ui-name : Insert Deviation (required if paired-end) (int)
        short-hint :  Estimated std. Deviation of insert size in bp
    is_rev_comped:
        ui-name : Library Read Orientation
        short-hint : |
            The read pairs should be either in the "outtie" orientation,
            i.e <-- --> or the "innie" orientation i.e. --> <--
    aggressive:
        ui-name : Aggressiveness (more sensitive & less specific)
        short-hint : |
            This only applies to metagenomes. It will give a more sensitive, less specific assembly.
    diploid:
        ui-name : level of heterozygosity (ploidy)
        short-hint : |
            Only applise to plants. Low heterzygosity is when there are less than 1 SNP per largest kmer length. So if you have 21,41,71 kmer sizes set for hipmer and 1 SNP per 71 bases, then you have high heterzygosity.
    usedebug:
        ui-name : debug queue for small jobs (30min limit)
        short-hint : |
            use debug queue for testing or jobs < 30 min (not recomended)

parameter-groups :
    reads :
        ui-name : Reads
        short-hint : |
            Reads objects and options to use in the assembly.
    is_meta:
        ui-name : Is this metagenome data 
        short-hint : |
            The assembly will use different heuristics to assembly metagenome data.
    is_plant:
        ui-name : Is this plant data 
        short-hint : |
            The assembly will use different heuristics to assembly plant data.

    <p>KBase wrapper for the HipMer Assembler (v1.2.2-7).</p>
    <p>HipMer is a high performance parallelization and port of Meraculous ( http://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/meraculous/ ).
       It is largely written in UPC, with the exception of the UFX generation, which is written in C++/MPI.</p>
    <p>For more details see: https://sourceforge.net/p/hipmer/wiki/Home/</p>
    <p>This project is a joint collaboration between UC Berkeley ( http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu ),
    JGI ( http://jgi.doe.gov ), and CRD ( http://crd.lbl.gov/ )</p>

    <p>Primary authors are: Evangelos Georganas, Aydin Buluc, Steven Hofmeyr, Leonid Oliker and
    Rob Egan, with direction and advice from Kathy Yelick. The original Meraculous was developed by
    Jarrod Chapman, Isaac Ho, Eugene Goltsman, and Daniel Rokhsar.</p>
